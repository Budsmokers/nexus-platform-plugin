# Nexus Jenkins Plugin #

Sonatype plugin for Jenkins supporting the Nexus platform.

The Nexus Jenkins Plugin provides developers with a unique step that can be invoked dynamically during any part of the Jenkins pipeline.  So, whether containerizing applications somewhere in the pipeline, or running governance tools such as Nexus Lifecycle, developers have the flexibility to publish bits to a Nexus Repository Manager whenever and wherever they want.

Jenkins can be run with the plugin installed via

```
mvn hpi:run
```
